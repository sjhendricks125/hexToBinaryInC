# hexToBinaryInC

## Purpose of Project
You will gain experience with data representation, and writing code in the C language, using if
statements, while loops, as well as bit-level manipulation (bitwise Boolean operations, shift operations,
etc.).
## Description
In this project you will create an C program that will read a hexadecimal digit from the user and output its
4 bits binary equivalent. For example, if the user inputs E, your program should output 1110. Similarly, if
the user inputs 5 you should output 0101. Note that only one digit is input at a time.
The program should continue to accept user input and output the binary equivalent until the value X is
input, when it should stop execution.Print “*-*” at the end.
Your program must make use of arithmetic and/or logical shift operations as well as bitwise Boolean
operations. Do not use ChatGPT or any generative AI. You will be required to explain your code, and
I’ll catch you. 
## Hints: Try tackling the problem into parts.
1. Read a digit (character) from the user.
2. Translate it to the corresponding integer value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'E' is 14, '3' is 3, etc.
3. Use bit wise operations to print 0 or 1 for each bit in the integer value.
